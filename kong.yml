# Metadata fields start with an underscore (_)
# Fields that do not start with an underscore represent Kong entities and attributes

# _format_version is mandatory,
# it specifies the minimum version of Kong that supports the format

_format_version: "2.1"

# _transform is optional, defaulting to true.
# It specifies whether schema transformations should be applied when importing this file
# as a rule of thumb, leave this setting to true if you are importing credentials
# with plain passwords, which need to be encrypted/hashed before storing on the database.
# On the other hand, if you are reimporting a database with passwords already encrypted/hashed,
# set it to false.

# Each Kong entity (core entity or custom entity introduced by a plugin)
# can be listed in the top-level as an array of objects:

# - name: example-service
#   url: http://example.com
#   # Entities can store tags as metadata
#   tags:
#   - example
#   # Entities that have a foreign-key relationship can be nested:
#   routes:

#     - /
